    description: "The fifth-generation Volkswagen Polo featured more distinctive styling with sharper lines, a more assertive front end, and overall more confident design than its predecessor, following Volkswagen's evolving design language under Walter de Silva's direction. Built on an updated version of the PQ25 platform, this generation grew slightly in all dimensions, particularly width, creating a more substantial presence while improving interior space. Available primarily in three and five-door hatchback body styles, with sedan variants again offered in selected markets outside Western Europe under various names, the fifth-generation Polo emphasized quality and technology. Engine options included a wide range of efficient TSI petrol and TDI diesel units, with innovations including direct injection, turbocharging, and BlueMotion efficiency technologies, power outputs ranging from approximately 60 to 190 horsepower in the Polo GTI, which received the 1.8-liter TSI engine in its later iterations after starting with a 1.4-liter twincharger. Transmission choices included five and six-speed manuals, a seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic, and in some markets, conventional automatics. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and technology, offering features unexpected in the supermini segment including available touchscreen infotainment systems, automatic climate control, adaptive cruise control, and comprehensive safety features with multiple airbags, electronic stability control, and later, autonomous emergency braking. A facelift in 2014 (sometimes designated 6C) brought revised styling, enhanced interior technology, and additional efficiency improvements. This generation further elevated the Polo's position with a focus on refinement, technology, and quality that approached levels previously associated with larger vehicles, solidifying the model's premium positioning within the supermini segment while maintaining its practical, efficient character."
